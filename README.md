# Predicting-SONAR-rocks-against-Mines-with-the-help-of-Machine-Learning
SONAR is an abbreviation for Sound Navigation and Ranging. It detects submerged things using sound waves. Deep learning and machine learning-based techniques have applications in recognizing sonar sounds and hence targets.
Fourier transform, wavelet transform, limit cycle, etc. are signal processing methods applicable for an underwater acoustic signal. Machine Learning enables the processing of sonar signals and target detection. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence which tells machines how to manipulate data more proficiently. The three stages of Machine Learning are taking some data as input, extracting features, and predicting new patterns.
